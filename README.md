## Description

code for experiments in the paper "Convergence Rates of Zeroth-order Gradient Descent for Łojasiewicz Functions'' by Tianyu Wang and Yasong Feng.

The file "exp.ipynb" contains codes for experiments in the main text of the paper, and the file "exp-linesearch.ipynb" contains codes for experiments in the appendix of the paper.

Running "exp.ipynb" and "exp-linesearch.ipynb" will create raw data in the "raw_data" folder. After the raw data are in place, running "plotting.ipynb" and "plotting-linesearch.ipynb" will save plots in the "figures" folder.

You may need to manually create the folder "raw_data" and or "figures" on your local repo.

## Ongoing Development

This code is being developed on an on-going basis at the author-maintained 
[Github repo](https://github.com/wangt1anyu/code-zeroth-order-Lojasiewicz).

## Support
